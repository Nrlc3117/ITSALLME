# ITSALLME 
I have no idea how to do this I do not know what this is I'm just trying something new because I've been to many places in my life to not try something at least one time because life is throwing me every which way I've been human trafficked I've been beaten I've been almost burned alive in a house fire I've had twins that are amazing I have four kids I have a deceased husband that was killed in a semi car accident I lost everything to a house fire I was attacked by a wolf when I was a child with 17 holes and 32 stitches around my head and neck stitched up with no numbing of any sort held down by 10 doctors for the first minute of my life my mom had a double for the breach when I was born and I didn't have any oxygen for the first minute of my life I have great ideas I've invented card games I am an idealist I wanna know everything about everything and I'm willing to try anything and most things in life are common sense but this is one thing that is super confusing but so so interesting that I wish somebody could teach me and reach out to me my telephone number is 51585126 03 and I'm hoping you text message me so I know what the call is about before I talk to you because I get a lot of harassing phone calls and stuff considering my son's father is an abusive piece of shit who has stolen my identity and sold it and it is on the dark web and I have no credit that is worth a fuck and yeah but I'm a good Christian person who believes anything is possible because with God all things are possible and it's all things aren't possible to at the same time what is can also be what is notAnd life is about the what if I want to know why things are the way they are and why they aren't the way they're not
